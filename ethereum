A hyperledger fabric network is a collection of nodes which are all on the same channel. They communicate with each other using peer protocols. Each one is made up of two distinct roles, peers and orderers.
The hyperledger fabric network consists of many channels, each within its own virtual private network (VPN). <a href="https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-hyperledger-fabric/">Hyperledger fabric node deployment</a>
 uses channels to isolate the transactions within each channel, which are only visible to other peers on that same channel.
